# AnnToTheRescue
Implementing Approximate k Nearest Neighbors

### Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Running the Example

The `__main__` section in the script demonstrates:

- Generating 100 random 2D vectors
- Building the AnnTree
- Querying for the K=10 nearest neighbors to a random point
- Plotting the query, dataset, and selected neighbors

To run:

```
python ann_tree.py

```

### File Structure

- `ann_tree.py` – Main implementation of the tree and helper classes.
- `requirements.txt` – List of dependencies.
- `README.md` – This file.
